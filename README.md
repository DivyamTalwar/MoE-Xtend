# MoE-Xtend
**Context Unbound. Intelligence Unleashed.**

MoE-Xtend is a research-first, production-ready Mixture-of-Experts transformer stack built for long-context scaling, Harmony-native prompting, and precision-controlled inference. This repo is the foundation for a fully self-contained, formula-rich technical reference and visual system.

## Status
- README + visual system are being rebuilt from scratch.
- All assets will be local (SVG/GIF), optimized for GitHub rendering.
- Next drop will include architecture diagrams, RoPE/YaRN math, attention flow visualizations, and benchmarking flows.

## Goal
Deliver the cleanest, deepest, and most self-sufficient MoE + long-context implementation docs on GitHub.
